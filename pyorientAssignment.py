# [ANALYZE THE RETURNED RECORDS TO DETERMINE THE MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, AND AVERAGE PRICE OF THE LISTINGS]
# Hint: the loop that you need to look into each record is already provided below.
# To find the average price, add up all the prices and divide by the number of results
# To find the minimum price, create a variable and initialize it to a very large number, 
# then test each price to see if it is smaller than the current minimum. If it is, update 
# the minimum variable with that price. You can do something similar to find the maximum.
